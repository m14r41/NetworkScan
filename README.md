1. **Scan Live Subnet IP Addresses:** The tool scans the entire provided subnet to identify all live IP addresses, saving the results. It also provides the total count of live IP addresses in the subnet.

2. **Scan Specific IP Addresses:** Users can input one or more specific IP addresses, and the tool checks their live status and saves the results.

3. **TCP Port Scan:** It performs a TCP port scan on all the provided IP addresses to identify open ports and services. This can help in understanding the network services available on each IP.

4. **UDP Port Scan:** The tool also conducts a UDP port scan on the specified IP addresses, revealing any open UDP ports and associated services, if any.

5. **Specify a Folder for Result Storage:** After completing the scans, the tool allows users to specify a folder location where the scan results will be saved. This feature ensures organized storage of scan reports.

6. **Completion and Results:** Once the scans are finished, the tool indicates the process is done, and users can access the saved scan results in the specified folder.

This tool streamlines the process of scanning and identifying live IP addresses, conducting TCP and UDP port scans on them, and efficiently managing the scan results. It's a valuable asset for network administrators and security professionals seeking to assess and secure their networks.
